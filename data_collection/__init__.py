"""Data collection package for TAIPPA.

This package contains modules for scraping and processing real influencer
profiles from various social media platforms.  The goal is to build a
scalable data collection framework that can discover and enrich
influencer information for use within the TAIPPA platform.  Actual
execution of scraping tasks may require authentication or API keys,
which should be provided by the user at runtime.  The modules here
provide a structured foundation for such scraping and can be extended
with platformâ€‘specific details.
