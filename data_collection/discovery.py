"""Algorithms for discovering influencer profiles by category and keyword.

This module defines functions that search social media platforms for
influencers matching specific categories, hashtags or keywords.  The
implementation of the discovery functions is intentionally left
incomplete because real discovery typically requires interacting
with platform APIs or performing sophisticated scraping of search
results.  Users of the framework should extend these functions with
actual discovery logic suitable for their environment and provide
authentication credentials when necessary.
